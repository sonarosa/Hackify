*Automated Medical Assistant and Smart Chatbot*
An AI Assistant for Junior Doctors: Diagnosis, Treatment Planning, and Smart Chatbot for document-based queries.

The challenge faced by junior doctors and medical interns in interpreting complex medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, while managing a heavy workload, can have a significant impact on patient care and outcomes. Delays in diagnosis or misinterpretation of critical findings may occur, leading to delays in treatment and potentially adverse outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. Furthermore, early-career physicians may struggle to access specialized knowledge and formulate appropriate treatment plans, resulting in reliance on more experienced colleagues for guidance. This reliance not only adds to the burden on senior doctors but also slows down the on-point delivery of patient care.

To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an AI-assisted platform that provides reliable diagnostic support very easily, treatment planning guidance, and access to specialized knowledge for junior doctors and medical residents. Such a platform would empower these healthcare professionals to interpret medical images accurately, formulate evidence-based treatment plans, and make informed clinical decisions without relying heavily on senior physicians. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, this solution aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, streamline the treatment planning process, and reduce the dependency on senior physicians for routine consultations.
